# tzebruh-hyprland-dots

These are my personal Hyprland configuration files. I'm an absolute beginner to Arch and Hyprland so they may not be the best and the file contents are quite messy, but I think they're pretty good for a first time. I'll update this repo whenever I make big changes to them, but it should mostly stay the same for the time being.
